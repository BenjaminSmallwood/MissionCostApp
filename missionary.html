            <h1>David Livingstone</h1>
            <h2>How He Made a Difference</h2>
            <p> David Livingstone was a Scottish physician, Congregationalist, and pioneer Christian missionary with the London Missionary Society, an explorer in Africa, and one of the most popular British heroes of the late 19th-century Victorian era. He
                had a mythical status that operated on a number of interconnected levels: Protestant missionary martyr, working-class "rags-to-riches" inspirational story, scientific investigator and explorer, imperial reformer, anti-slavery crusader,
                and advocate of British commercial and colonial expansion.</p>
            <h2>Verse About Mission Work</h2>
            <p>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of
                the age.‚Äù - Matthew 28:19-20</p>
