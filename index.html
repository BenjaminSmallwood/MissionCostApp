            <p> Hey everyone, my name is <b>Ben Smallwood</b>. I am from Northern Virginia and have been going to LUO for the last 2 years to finish up my degree in web and mobile programming. I'm excited to start moving away from just creating websites and
                starting making web applications in this class! I have 5 other siblings in my family including a twin brother and I enjoy gaming, running, and playing soccer, (as well as <i>coding</i> but that should be obvious). After this course, I'm
                completed with my degree and looking at getting a job nearby! I hope everyone has a great next 8 weeks and can learn how to make web applications!</p>
